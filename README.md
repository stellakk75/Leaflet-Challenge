# Leaflet-Challenge

**This assignment uses HTML/CSS/Javascript-Leaflet to visualize a map of earthquakes based on USGS geoJSON feed. The Leaftlet map plots all given earthquake locations with color and size variations based on earthquake magnitude in addition to clickable information popups. Teconic plate lines, basemaps and removable layers are provided in Step 2 map files.**

* Script includes:
  * Render leaflet map 
  * Load TileLayers
  * Connect to geojson API using D3
  * Create a legend showing the magnitude and its corresponding colors
  * Scaled and colored data points with magnitude level
  * Functional tooltip at each data point 
  * Change basemap with add/remove layers option
  * Show tectonic plate lines on map
